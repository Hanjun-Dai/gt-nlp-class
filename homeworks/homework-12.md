# Homework 12: Information Extraction #

When you search Google for a well-known person, they display some
details about the person to the right of the search results. For
example, try searching for “Maynard Jackson“

Choose an individual with at least three fields besides birth and
death dates. Then go to the wikipedia page for that individual, and
see where and if those fields are mentioned in the text (not in the
information box on the right side of the wikipedia page). For each
field, try to design a pattern that would extract the correct value,
if possible. Would your pattern also apply to other parts of the next
which do not actually match the desired field? Does the Google
description actually extract all the information correctly? (for
Maynard Jackson, it does not.)
