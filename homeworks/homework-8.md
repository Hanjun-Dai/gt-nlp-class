Frame semantics
----------

In this homework, you will perform a frame semantic analysis on two sentences. Use the [Illinois Semantic Role Labeling online demo](http://cogcomp.cs.illinois.edu/page/demo_view/srl) to analyze two sentences:

- "Wind gusts as strong as 99 mph battered the south coast of England, and authorities warned of travel disruptions across the region."
- A sentence of your choice from this week's news.

Indicate all the SRL frames instantiated by the system, and whether you agree with them.

Here are a few references to help:
