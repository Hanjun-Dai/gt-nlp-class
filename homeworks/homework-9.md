U.S. fast-food workers launched a nationwide protest in New York on Tuesday to argue for higher wages and union rights that they hope will catch the attention of candidates in the 2016 elections.

A couple hundred protesters marched in downtown Brooklyn, blocking traffic and carrying banners reading "A living wage = quality care" and "On strike for work that sustains families." The protesters stopped to rally outside a McDonald's restaurant.

Organizers of the Fight for $15 campaign say the protests will be followed by rallies in 500 cities by low-wage workers in such sectors as fast food and home and child care.

The protests and strikes are aimed at gaining candidates' support heading into the 2016 U.S. presidential election for a minimum wage of $15 an hour and union rights, the group said.

"The money I bring home can barely take care of my rent," said protester Alvin Major, 50, a Guyanese native who said he earns about $1,200 a month with his job at a Brooklyn KFC, not enough to cover expenses of his four children and ill wife. "We need a wage that could take care of our basic necessities."
