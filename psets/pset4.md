Problem set 4: Discriminative sequence labeling
============

All materials are in the "ps4" folder. Start with the notebook pset4.ipynb.

You may want to use some of your code from psets 2 and 3 here.
That's fine, but just remember that your submission should be self-contained.
So, make sure you include whatever code you use with the rest of this assignment.
Please use the ```createSubmission.sh``` script to create submission tarball to make sure we have all the necessary materials.
