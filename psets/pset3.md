Problem set 3: Hidden Markov Models
============

All materials are in the "ps3" folder. Start with the notebook pset3.ipynb.

You may want to use some of your code from pset 2 here. That's fine, but just remember that your submission should be self-contained. So, make sure you include whatever code you use with the rest of this assignment.
